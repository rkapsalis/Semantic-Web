## Exercise 2
In this assignment an RDFS university ontology was created containing:
* 6 Classes
* 9 Properties

and filled with:
* 8 University departments
* 11 Professors
* 17 Students
* 10 Courses
* 16 Classrooms

Then some SPARQL queries were executed in this ontology.
Finally, an app in JAVA was developed, using JenaAPI allowing the user to select a Department and display all the information related to it, add new data to the ontology and run a search by giving the URI of a resource.

## Project
A football OWL ontology was created in Protege.

Also, an application in Java was developed. The application:
* Loads the football OWL ontology and applies an Inference model
* Allows the retrieval and display of snapshots of the ontology after the selection of a class by the user.
* Allows the insertion of new snapshots.
* Allows the search of snapshots based on user-defined parameter values, using SPARQL queries.
* Allows the search of snapshots based on parameter values, to be specified by the user.
